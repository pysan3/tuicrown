# TuiCrown

Tuicrown is a Nim library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.

This is possible with a very easy syntax as follows.

- `[style]`: Styles are defined inside `[` and `]`.
- `[/style]`: `/` means to revert (undo) the style.
- `[/]`: Reverts all style modification.

## Installation

‚ùó This is still in alpha stage.

- API may change without notice.

```bash
nimble install https://github.com/pysan3/tuicrown
```

- I will release this as a nimble package after `v1.0.0+`.
- Coming soon!!

## Usage

```nim
import tuicrown/console

let cons = newTuiConsole(newTuiConsoleOptions()) # Console object with default options

cons.print("[i green]italic green text[/]")
```

## Syntax

[`Tuicrown`](https://github.com/pysan3/tuicrown)'s syntax is inspired by the [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) python library.
